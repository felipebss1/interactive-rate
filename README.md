## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first Workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In the beginning I was kinda lost but, as long I was developing this project I noticed I could go on and on. I choose Vue as my main framework, I felt like I could learn it kinda fast ( unfortunately it doesn't happened, but OK), but in the end i could learn it in a good time. I'm still struggling with Vue, but I feel like I can develop myself even further, I also could join Pinia in this project and make my progress even better. I'm really proud I could do it, althought it could have been done with pure HTML + CSS + JS.

### Continued development

I'll implement Vue in the next Frontend Mentor's projects and improve myself with this framework. I'll also learn even more about Pinia and try to complete complex projects as well.
